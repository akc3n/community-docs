before_text: |
  Many prospective GrapheneOS users are willing to take the plunge, but are understandably
  concerned that the apps that they regularly use will not work after transitioning.

  This list is an attempt to help the community keep track of apps that work as expected or have
  some issues running on GrapheneOS. Apps that need
  [Exploit Protection Compatibility Mode](@/app-compatibility/exploit_protection_compatibility_mode.md)
  on should be listed, as well as whether apps rely on Sandboxed Google Play to run. Or the occasional
  app that refuses to launch unless it's installed by Google Play.

  This page is a work in progress. The data are (as far as I know) accurate, but the page layout may change.
  
  The emojis below mean the following:
  
  - ✅ - The app works in general or works without certain restrictions
  - ⚠️ - The app works, but only with Exploit Protection Compatibility Mode set to "on"
  - ❌ - The app doesn't work at all on GrapheneOS, or it has certain restrictions
  - ❓ - Unknown whether the app works under the listed circumstance

  If any information on this list is incorrect, please open an issue on this site's {{ github_issues_link( text = "GitHub Issue Tracker") }}.
