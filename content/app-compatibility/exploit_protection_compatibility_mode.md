## Background 
One of GrapheneOS's best features is its hardened memory allocator, `hardened_malloc`. Its documentation can be found in its [GitHub repository's README.md](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc).

In a nutshell, GrapheneOS's `hardened_malloc` helps protect against memory bugs. According to Google's Chromium Project, around "70% of [their] serious security bugs are memory safety problems" ([source](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/memory-safety/)). So, clearly, GrapheneOS's `hardened_malloc` does some heavy lifting when it comes to keeping GrapheneOS users safe from exploits.

Unfortunately, most Android OSes don't have the same kind of protection, so when apps have memory issues, they sometimes don't know or can't explain why their app behaves strangely or crashes in seemingly random situations. But, on GrapheneOS, the apps will just crash.

## What's Exploit Protection Compatibility Mode For?

Users can optionally go back to using the default Android memory allocator so they can still use desired apps with memory issues.

To do so, go to: `Settings > Apps > All apps > APP NAME > Exploit Protection Compatibility Mode` and turn it on.

## Is it Safe to use Exploit Protection Compatibility Mode?

It all depends on the individual user's perspective. For most people, using an app with memory issues won't be a problem. Keep in mind that other apps will be safe. Also, there's still the app sandbox that helps isolate apps.
