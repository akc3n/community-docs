Although the GrapheneOS web installer has made flashing GrapheneOS very easy, sometimes people will experience issues. The first thing to do in this situation is to not panic. It's very unlikely that a Pixel will be "bricked" while flashing. It's very safe to flash a Pixel. If you encounter an error, don't be worried about trying again.

- Use a high quality cable. Usually the best option is the cable that came with the phone. Try a new cable if an error occurs. This fixes the majority of issues.
- Use a good port. Don't use an adapter or dongle. Connect directly. Don't use a desktop's front USB ports.
- Make sure you're using a supported browser. Don't use Snap installs because they have broken WebUSB.
- Do not install using Incognito mode.
- Try a different device or browser.
